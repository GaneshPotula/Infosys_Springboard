dialogue
"and what is the use of a book,"
without pictures or conversations?
"Oh
dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!"
"after such a fall as this, I shall
think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they’ll all think me
at home! Why, I wouldn’t say anything about it, even if I fell off the
top of the house!"
"I wonder how
many miles I’ve fallen by this time?"
"I must be
getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would
be four thousand miles down, I think—"
"—yes, that’s about the right distance—but
then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I’ve got to?"
"I wonder if I shall fall right _through_
the earth! How funny it’ll seem to come out among the people that walk
with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think—"
"—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the
country is, you know. Please, Ma’am, is this New Zealand or Australia?"
"And what
an ignorant little girl she’ll think me for asking! No, it’ll never do
to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere."
"Dinah’ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!"
"I hope they’ll remember her saucer of milk at
tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are
no mice in the air, I’m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that’s
very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?"
Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?
Do bats eat cats?
"Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?"
"Oh my ears
and whiskers, how late it’s getting!"
"and even if my head would go through,"
"it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh,
how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only
knew how to begin."
"which certainly was not here
before,"
"No, I’ll look first,"
and see whether it’s marked ‘_poison_’ or not
What a curious feeling!
"I must be shutting up like a
telescope."
"for it might end, you know,"
"in my going out altogether, like a candle. I
wonder what I should be like then?"
"Come, there’s no use in crying like that!"
I advise you to leave off this minute!
"But it’s no use now,"
"to pretend to be two
people! Why, there’s hardly enough of me left to make _one_ respectable
person!"
"Well, I’ll eat it,"
"and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it
makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I’ll
get into the garden, and I don’t care which happens!"
"Which way? Which
way?"
Curiouser and curiouser!
"now I’m
opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!"
"Oh, my poor little feet, I
wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I’m
sure _I_ shan’t be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble
myself about you: you must manage the best way you can;—but I must be
kind to them,"
"or perhaps they won’t walk the way I
want to go! Let me see: I’ll give them a new pair of boots every
Christmas."
"They must
go by the carrier,"
"and how funny it’ll seem, sending
presents to one’s own feet! And how odd the directions will look!
     _Alice’s Right Foot, Esq., Hearthrug, near the Fender,_ (_with
     Alice’s love_).
Oh dear, what nonsense I’m talking!"
"You ought to be ashamed of yourself,"
"a great girl like
you,"
"to go on crying in this way! Stop
this moment, I tell you!"
"Oh! the Duchess, the
Duchess! Oh! won’t she be savage if I’ve kept her waiting!"
"If you please,
sir—"
"Dear, dear! How
queer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual.
I wonder if I’ve been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the
same when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling
a little different. But if I’m not the same, the next question is, Who
in the world am I? Ah, _that’s_ the great puzzle!"
"I’m sure I’m not Ada,"
"for her hair goes in such long
ringlets, and mine doesn’t go in ringlets at all; and I’m sure I can’t
be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a
very little! Besides, _she’s_ she, and _I’m_ I, and—oh dear, how
puzzling it all is! I’ll try if I know all the things I used to know.
Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen,
and four times seven is—oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that
rate! However, the Multiplication Table doesn’t signify: let’s try
Geography. London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of
Rome, and Rome—no, _that’s_ all wrong, I’m certain! I must have been
changed for Mabel! I’ll try and say ‘_How doth the little_—’"
"How doth the little crocodile
    Improve his shining tail,
And pour the waters of the Nile
    On every golden scale!
“How cheerfully he seems to grin,
    How neatly spread his claws,
And welcome little fishes in
    With gently smiling jaws!"
"I’m sure those are not the right words,"
"I must be Mabel after all, and
I shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to
no toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, I’ve
made up my mind about it; if I’m Mabel, I’ll stay down here! It’ll be
no use their putting their heads down and saying ‘Come up again, dear!’
I shall only look up and say ‘Who am I then? Tell me that first, and
then, if I like being that person, I’ll come up: if not, I’ll stay down
here till I’m somebody else’—but, oh dear!"
"I do wish they _would_ put their heads down! I am so
_very_ tired of being all alone here!"
How _can_ I have done that?
"I must be
growing small again."
That _was_ a narrow escape!
"and
now for the garden!"
"and things are worse than
ever,"
"for I never was so small as this
before, never! And I declare it’s too bad, that it is!"
"and in that case I can go back by
railway,"
I wish I hadn’t cried so much!
"I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by
being drowned in my own tears! That _will_ be a queer thing, to be
sure! However, everything is queer to-day."
"Would it be of any use, now,"
"to speak to this mouse?
Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very
likely it can talk: at any rate, there’s no harm in trying."
"O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired
of swimming about here, O Mouse!"
"A mouse—of
a mouse—to a mouse—a mouse—O mouse!"
"Perhaps it doesn’t understand English,"
"I daresay it’s
a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror."
Où est ma chatte?
"Oh, I beg your pardon!"
"I quite forgot you didn’t like
cats."
"Would
_you_ like cats if you were me?"
"don’t be angry
about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you’d
take a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear
quiet thing,"
"and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her
paws and washing her face—and she is such a nice soft thing to
nurse—and she’s such a capital one for catching mice—oh, I beg your
pardon!"
"We won’t talk
about her any more if you’d rather not."
"As if _I_ would talk on such a subject! Our family always
_hated_ cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don’t let me hear the name
again!"
Are you—are you fond—of—of dogs?
"There is such a nice little dog near
our house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you
know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it’ll fetch things when
you throw them, and it’ll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts
of things—I can’t remember half of them—and it belongs to a farmer, you
know, and he says it’s so useful, it’s worth a hundred pounds! He says
it kills all the rats and—oh dear!"
I’m afraid I’ve offended it again!
"Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we
won’t talk about cats or dogs either, if you don’t like them!"
"Let us get to the shore, and then I’ll tell you my
history, and you’ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs."
"I am
older than you, and must know better;"
"Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! _I’ll_ soon make
you dry enough!"
"are you all ready? This
is the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! ‘William
the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted
to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much
accustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of
Mercia and Northumbria—’"
I beg your pardon!
"I thought you did,"
"—I proceed. ‘Edwin and Morcar,
the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even
Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable—’"
"of course you know
what ‘it’ means."
"I know what ‘it’ means well enough, when _I_ find a thing,"
"it’s generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the
archbishop find?"
"‘—found
it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him
the crown. William’s conduct at first was moderate. But the insolence
of his Normans—’ How are you getting on now, my dear?"
"As wet as ever,"
"it doesn’t seem to
dry me at all."
"I move
that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic
remedies—"
"I don’t know the meaning of half
those long words, and, what’s more, I don’t believe you do either!"
"What I was going to say,"
"was,
that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race."
What _is_ a Caucus-race?
the best way to explain it is to do it.
"the exact
shape doesn’t matter,"
"One, two, three, and
away,"
The race is over!
But who has won?
"_Everybody_ has won, and all must have prizes."
But who is to give the prizes?
"Why, _she_, of course,"
"But she must have a prize herself, you know,"
"What else have you got in
your pocket?"
"Hand it over here,"
"We beg your acceptance of this elegant
thimble;"
"You promised to tell me your history, you know,"
"and why
it is you hate—C and D,"
Mine is a long and a sad tale!
"It _is_ a long tail, certainly,"
but why do you call it sad?
"Fury said to a mouse, That he met in the house, ‘Let us both
         go to law: _I_ will prosecute _you_.—Come, I’ll take no
         denial; We must have a trial: For really this morning I’ve
         nothing to do.’ Said the mouse to the cur, ‘Such a trial, dear
         sir, With no jury or judge, would be wasting our breath.’
         ‘I’ll be judge, I’ll be jury,’ Said cunning old Fury: ‘I’ll
         try the whole cause, and condemn you to death.’"
You are not attending!
"What are
you thinking of?"
"I beg your pardon,"
"you had got to the fifth
bend, I think?"
"Oh, do let me help to undo it!"
"I shall do nothing of the sort,"
You insult me by talking such nonsense!
I didn’t mean it!
"But you’re so easily offended,
you know!"
Please come back and finish your story!
What a pity it wouldn’t stay!
"Ah, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you never to lose
_your_ temper!"
"Hold your tongue, Ma!"
You’re enough to try the patience of an oyster!
"I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!"
She’d soon fetch it back!
"And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?"
"Dinah’s our cat. And she’s such a capital one for catching mice you
can’t think! And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds! Why,
she’ll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!"
"I really must be getting home; the night-air
doesn’t suit my throat!"
"Come away, my dears! It’s high time you were all in
bed!"
I wish I hadn’t mentioned Dinah!
"Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I’m sure she’s the best
cat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you
any more!"
"The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh
my fur and whiskers! She’ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are
ferrets! Where _can_ I have dropped them, I wonder?"
"Why, Mary Ann, what _are_ you
doing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and
a fan! Quick, now!"
"He took me for his housemaid,"
"How
surprised he’ll be when he finds out who I am! But I’d better take him
his fan and gloves—that is, if I can find them."
"How queer it seems,"
"to be going messages for
a rabbit! I suppose Dinah’ll be sending me on messages next!"
"‘Miss Alice! Come
here directly, and get ready for your walk!’ ‘Coming in a minute,
nurse! But I’ve got to see that the mouse doesn’t get out.’ Only I
don’t think,"
"that they’d let Dinah stop in the house
if it began ordering people about like that!"
"I know _something_ interesting is sure to
happen,"
"whenever I eat or drink anything; so
I’ll just see what this bottle does. I do hope it’ll make me grow large
again, for really I’m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!"
"That’s quite enough—I hope I shan’t
grow any more—As it is, I can’t get out at the door—I do wish I hadn’t
drunk quite so much!"
"Now I
can do no more, whatever happens. What _will_ become of me?"
"It was much pleasanter at home,"
"when one wasn’t
always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and
rabbits. I almost wish I hadn’t gone down that rabbit-hole—and yet—and
yet—it’s rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what
_can_ have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied
that kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of
one! There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And
when I grow up, I’ll write one—but I’m grown up now,"
at least there’s no room to grow up any more _here_.
"shall I _never_ get any older than I am
now? That’ll be a comfort, one way—never to be an old woman—but
then—always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn’t like _that!_"
"Oh, you foolish Alice!"
"How can you learn
lessons in here? Why, there’s hardly room for _you_, and no room at all
for any lesson-books!"
Mary Ann! Mary Ann!
Fetch me my gloves this moment!
"Then I’ll
go round and get in at the window."
Pat! Pat! Where are you?
"Sure then I’m here! Digging
for apples, yer honour!"
"Digging for apples, indeed!"
"Here! Come and
help me out of _this!_"
"Now tell me, Pat, what’s that in the window?"
"Sure, it’s an arm, yer honour!"
"An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole
window!"
"Sure, it does, yer honour: but it’s an arm for all that."
"Well, it’s got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!"
"Sure, I don’t like it, yer honour, at all, at
all!"
"Do as I tell you, you coward!"
"What a number
of cucumber-frames there must be!"
"I wonder what
they’ll do next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they
_could!_ I’m sure _I_ don’t want to stay in here any longer!"
"Where’s the other
ladder?—Why, I hadn’t to bring but one; Bill’s got the other—Bill!
fetch it here, lad!—Here, put ’em up at this corner—No, tie ’em
together first—they don’t reach half high enough yet—Oh! they’ll do
well enough; don’t be particular—Here, Bill! catch hold of this
rope—Will the roof bear?—Mind that loose slate—Oh, it’s coming down!
Heads below!"
"Now, who did that?—It was Bill, I
fancy—Who’s to go down the chimney?—Nay, _I_ shan’t! _You_ do
it!—_That_ I won’t, then!—Bill’s to go down—Here, Bill! the master says
you’re to go down the chimney!"
"Oh! So Bill’s got to come down the chimney, has he?"
"Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill! I wouldn’t be in
Bill’s place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but
I _think_ I can kick a little!"
"Catch him, you by the hedge!"
"Hold up his head—Brandy
now—Don’t choke him—How was it, old fellow? What happened to you? Tell
us all about it!"
"Well, I hardly know—No more, thank ye; I’m better now—but I’m
a deal too flustered to tell you—all I know is, something comes at me
like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket!"
"So you did, old fellow!"
We must burn the house down!
"If you do, I’ll set Dinah at you!"
"I
wonder what they _will_ do next! If they had any sense, they’d take the
roof off."
"A barrowful will do, to begin with."
A barrowful of _what?_
"I’ll put a stop to
this,"
"You’d better not do that
again!"
"If I eat one of these cakes,"
"it’s sure to make
_some_ change in my size; and as it can’t possibly make me larger, it
must make me smaller, I suppose."
"The first thing I’ve got to do,"
"is to grow to my right size again; and the
second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that
will be the best plan."
And yet what a dear little puppy it was!
"I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if—if I’d
only been the right size to do it! Oh dear! I’d nearly forgotten that
I’ve got to grow up again! Let me see—how _is_ it to be managed? I
suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great
question is, what?"
"I—I hardly know, sir, just at present—at least I know
who I _was_ when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been
changed several times since then."
What do you mean by that?
"I can’t explain _myself_, I’m afraid, sir,"
"because I’m
not myself, you see."
"I’m afraid I can’t put it more clearly,"
"for I can’t understand it myself to begin with; and being so many
different sizes in a day is very confusing."
"Well, perhaps you haven’t found it so yet,"
"but when you
have to turn into a chrysalis—you will some day, you know—and then
after that into a butterfly, I should think you’ll feel it a little
queer, won’t you?"
"Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,"
"all I know
is, it would feel very queer to _me_."
"I
think, you ought to tell me who _you_ are, first."
"I’ve something
important to say!"
"So you
think you’re changed, do you?"
"I’m afraid I am, sir,"
"I can’t remember things as I
used—and I don’t keep the same size for ten minutes together!"
Can’t remember _what_ things?
"Well, I’ve tried to say “How doth the little busy bee,"
"Repeat, ‘_You are old, Father William_,’"
"You are old, Father William,"
"And your hair has become very white;
And yet you incessantly stand on your head—
    Do you think, at your age, it is right?"
"I feared it might injure the brain;
But, now that I’m perfectly sure I have none,
    Why, I do it again and again."
"as I mentioned before,
    And have grown most uncommonly fat;
Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door—
    Pray, what is the reason of that?"
"I kept all my limbs very supple
By the use of this ointment—one shilling the box—
    Allow me to sell you a couple?"
"and your jaws are too weak
    For anything tougher than suet;
Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak—
    Pray, how did you manage to do it?"
"I took to the law,
    And argued each case with my wife;
And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,
    Has lasted the rest of my life."
"one would hardly suppose
    That your eye was as steady as ever;
Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose—
    What made you so awfully clever?"
"I have answered three questions, and that is enough,"
"don’t give yourself airs!
Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?
    Be off, or I’ll kick you down stairs!"
"That is not said right,"
"Not _quite_ right, I’m afraid,"
"some of the
words have got altered."
"It is wrong from beginning to end,"
What size do you want to be?
"Oh, I’m not particular as to size,"
"only one
doesn’t like changing so often, you know."
Are you content now?
"Well, I should like to be a _little_ larger, sir, if you wouldn’t
mind,"
three inches is such a wretched height to be.
It is a very good height indeed!
But I’m not used to it!
"I wish the creatures wouldn’t be so easily
offended!"
"You’ll get used to it in time,"
"One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you
grow shorter."
One side of _what?_ The other side of _what?_
And now which is which?
"Come, my head’s free at last!"
What _can_ all that green stuff be?
"And where _have_ my
shoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can’t see you?"
I’m _not_ a serpent!
"Serpent, I say again!"
"I’ve tried every way, and nothing
seems to suit them!"
"I haven’t the least idea what you’re talking about,"
"I’ve tried the roots of trees, and I’ve tried banks, and I’ve tried
hedges,"
"but those
serpents! There’s no pleasing them!"
"As if it wasn’t trouble enough hatching the eggs,"
"but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day! Why, I
haven’t had a wink of sleep these three weeks!"
"I’m very sorry you’ve been annoyed,"
"And just as I’d taken the highest tree in the wood,"
"and just as I was thinking I
should be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down
from the sky! Ugh, Serpent!"
"But I’m _not_ a serpent, I tell you!"
Well! _What_ are you?
"I can see you’re trying to
invent something!"
"I—I’m a little girl,"
A likely story indeed!
"I’ve seen a good many little girls in my time, but never
_one_ with such a neck as that! No, no! You’re a serpent; and there’s
no use denying it. I suppose you’ll be telling me next that you never
tasted an egg!"
"I _have_ tasted eggs, certainly,"
"but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you
know."
"I don’t believe it,"
"but if they do, why then
they’re a kind of serpent, that’s all I can say."
"You’re
looking for eggs, I know _that_ well enough; and what does it matter to
me whether you’re a little girl or a serpent?"
"It matters a good deal to _me_,"
"but I’m not
looking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn’t want
_yours_: I don’t like them raw."
"Well, be off, then!"
"Come, there’s half my plan
done now! How puzzling all these changes are! I’m never sure what I’m
going to be, from one minute to another! However, I’ve got back to my
right size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden—how
_is_ that to be done, I wonder?"
"it’ll never do to come upon them
_this_ size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!"
"For the Duchess. An invitation from the
Queen to play croquet."
"From the Queen.
An invitation for the Duchess to play croquet."
"There’s no sort of use in knocking,"
"and that for
two reasons. First, because I’m on the same side of the door as you
are; secondly, because they’re making such a noise inside, no one could
possibly hear you."
how am I to get in?
"There might be some sense in your knocking,"
"if we had the door between us. For instance,
if you were _inside_, you might knock, and I could let you out, you
know."
"But perhaps he can’t help it,"
"his eyes are so _very_ nearly at the top of his
head. But at any rate he might answer questions.—How am I to get in?"
"I shall sit here,"
"—or next day, maybe,"
How am I to get in?
_Are_ you to get in at all?
"That’s the first
question, you know."
"the way all the creatures argue.
It’s enough to drive one crazy!"
"I shall sit here,"
"on and off, for
days and days."
But what am _I_ to do?
"Oh, there’s no use in talking to him,"
There’s certainly too much pepper in that soup!
"Please would you tell me,"
"why
your cat grins like that?"
"It’s a Cheshire cat,"
and that’s why. Pig!
"I didn’t know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn’t
know that cats _could_ grin."
and most of ’em do.
"I don’t know of any that do,"
"You don’t know much,"
and that’s a fact.
"Oh, _please_ mind what you’re doing!"
"Oh, there goes his _precious_ nose!"
"If everybody minded their own business,"
the world would go round a deal faster than it does.
"Which would _not_ be an advantage,"
"Just
think of what work it would make with the day and night! You see the
earth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis—"
chop off her head!
"Twenty-four hours, I _think_; or
is it twelve? I—"
"Oh, don’t bother _me_,"
"I never could abide
figures!"
"Speak roughly to your little boy,
    And beat him when he sneezes:
He only does it to annoy,
    Because he knows it teases."
"I speak severely to my boy,
    I beat him when he sneezes;
For he can thoroughly enjoy
    The pepper when he pleases!"
"Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!"
"I must go and get ready to play
croquet with the Queen,"
"just like a star-fish,"
"If I don’t take this child away with me,"
"they’re sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn’t it be
murder to leave it behind?"
"that’s not at all a proper way of
expressing yourself."
"But perhaps it was only
sobbing,"
"If you’re going to turn into a pig, my dear,"
"I’ll have nothing more to do with you. Mind
now!"
"Now, what am I to do
with this creature when I get it home?"
"If it had grown up,"
"it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes
rather a handsome pig, I think."
if one only knew the right way to change them—
"Come, it’s pleased so far,"
"Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?"
"That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,"
I don’t much care where—
"Then it doesn’t matter which way you go,"
"—so long as I get _somewhere_,"
"Oh, you’re sure to do that,"
"if you only walk long
enough."
What sort of people live about here?
"lives
a Hatter: and in _that_ direction,"
"lives a
March Hare. Visit either you like: they’re both mad."
"But I don’t want to go among mad people,"
"Oh, you can’t help that,"
"we’re all mad here. I’m mad.
You’re mad."
How do you know I’m mad?
or you wouldn’t have come here.
"And how
do you know that you’re mad?"
a dog’s not mad. You grant that?
"you see, a dog growls when it’s angry,
and wags its tail when it’s pleased. Now _I_ growl when I’m pleased,
and wag my tail when I’m angry. Therefore I’m mad."
"_I_ call it purring, not growling,"
"Call it what you like,"
"Do you play croquet with the
Queen to-day?"
"I should like it very much,"
"but I haven’t been invited
yet."
"You’ll see me there,"
"By-the-bye, what became of the baby?"
"I’d nearly
forgotten to ask."
"It turned into a pig,"
"I thought it would,"
"I’ve seen hatters before,"
"the March Hare will be much the most interesting, and
perhaps as this is May it won’t be raving mad—at least not so mad as it
was in March."
"Did you say pig, or fig?"
"and I wish you wouldn’t keep appearing
and vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy."
"Well! I’ve often seen a cat without a grin,"
"but a
grin without a cat! It’s the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!"
"Suppose it should be raving mad after all!
I almost wish I’d gone to see the Hatter instead!"
"Very
uncomfortable for the Dormouse,"
"only, as it’s asleep,
I suppose it doesn’t mind."
No room! No room!
There’s _plenty_ of room!
"I don’t see any wine,"
"Then it wasn’t very civil of you to offer it,"
"It wasn’t very civil of you to sit down without being invited,"
"I didn’t know it was _your_ table,"
"it’s laid for a great
many more than three."
"Your hair wants cutting,"
"You should learn not to make personal remarks,"
Why is a raven like a writing-desk?
"Come, we shall have some fun now!"
"I’m glad they’ve
begun asking riddles.—I believe I can guess that,"
Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?
"Then you should say what you mean,"
"at least—at least I mean what I
say—that’s the same thing, you know."
Not the same thing a bit!
"You might just as well
say that ‘I see what I eat’ is the same thing as ‘I eat what I see’!"
"You might just as well say,"
"that ‘I like what
I get’ is the same thing as ‘I get what I like’!"
"You might just as well say,"
"that ‘I breathe when I sleep’ is the same thing
as ‘I sleep when I breathe’!"
"It _is_ the same thing with you,"
"What day of the month
is it?"
"I told you butter wouldn’t suit
the works!"
"It was the _best_ butter,"
"Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,"
you shouldn’t have put it in with the bread-knife.
"It was the _best_ butter,
you know."
"What a
funny watch!"
"It tells the day of the month, and doesn’t
tell what o’clock it is!"
"Does _your_ watch tell you what
year it is?"
"but that’s because it
stays the same year for such a long time together."
"Which is just the case with _mine_,"
"I don’t quite
understand you,"
"The Dormouse is asleep again,"
"Of course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself."
Have you guessed the riddle yet?
"No, I give it up,"
"I haven’t the slightest idea,"
"I think you might do something better with the
time,"
"than waste it in asking riddles that have no
answers."
"If you knew Time as well as I do,"
"you wouldn’t talk
about wasting _it_. It’s _him_."
"I don’t know what you mean,"
Of course you don’t!
I dare say you never even spoke to Time!
"but I know I have to beat
time when I learn music."
"Ah! that accounts for it,"
"He won’t stand beating.
Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he’d do almost anything
you liked with the clock. For instance, suppose it were nine o’clock in
the morning, just time to begin lessons: you’d only have to whisper a
hint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-past one,
time for dinner!"
"I only wish it was,"
"That would be grand, certainly,"
"but then—I
shouldn’t be hungry for it, you know."
"Not at first, perhaps,"
"but you could keep it to
half-past one as long as you liked."
Is that the way _you_ manage?
"We
quarrelled last March—just before _he_ went mad, you know—"
"—it was at the great concert
given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing
‘Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!
How I wonder what you’re at!’
You know the song, perhaps?"
"I’ve heard something like it,"
"It goes on, you know,"
"in this way:—
‘Up above the world you fly,
Like a tea-tray in the sky.
                    Twinkle, twinkle—’"
"_Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle_—"
"Well, I’d hardly finished the first verse,"
"when the
Queen jumped up and bawled out, ‘He’s murdering the time! Off with his
head!’"
"And ever since that,"
"he won’t
do a thing I ask! It’s always six o’clock now."
"Is that the reason so many
tea-things are put out here?"
"it’s always tea-time,
and we’ve no time to wash the things between whiles."
"Then you keep moving round, I suppose?"
as the things get used up.
But what happens when you come to the beginning again?
"Suppose we change the subject,"
I’m getting tired of this. I vote the young lady tells us a story.
"I’m afraid I don’t know one,"
Then the Dormouse shall!
I heard every word you fellows were saying.
Tell us a story!
"And be quick about it,"
"or you’ll be asleep again
before it’s done."
"Once upon a time there were three little sisters,"
"and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and
they lived at the bottom of a well—"
What did they live on?
"They lived on treacle,"
"They couldn’t have done that, you know,"
they’d have been ill.
"But
why did they live at the bottom of a well?"
"Take some more tea,"
"I’ve had nothing yet,"
"so I can’t
take more."
"You mean you can’t take _less_,"
"it’s very easy to
take _more_ than nothing."
"Nobody asked _your_ opinion,"
Who’s making personal remarks now?
Why did they live at the bottom of a well?
It was a treacle-well.
There’s no such thing!
"If you can’t be civil, you’d better finish the story for
yourself."
"No, please go on!"
"I won’t interrupt again. I
dare say there may be _one_."
"And so these three little sisters—they were learning to draw,
you know—"
What did they draw?
"I want a clean cup,"
"let’s all move one place
on."
"But I don’t understand. Where did they draw the treacle
from?"
"You can draw water out of a water-well,"
"so I should
think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well—eh, stupid?"
"But they were _in_ the well,"
"Of course they were,"
"They were learning to draw,"
"and they drew all manner of
things—everything that begins with an M—"
Why with an M?
"—that begins with an M, such as
mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness—you know you say
things are “much of a muchness"
"Really, now you ask me,"
"Then you shouldn’t talk,"
At any rate I’ll never go _there_ again!
"It’s the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in
all my life!"
"But
everything’s curious today. I think I may as well go in at once."
"Now, I’ll manage better this time,"
"Look out now, Five! Don’t go splashing paint over me
like that!"
"I couldn’t help it,"
"Seven jogged my
elbow."
"That’s right, Five! Always lay the
blame on others!"
_You’d_ better not talk!
"I heard the Queen say only
yesterday you deserved to be beheaded!"
"That’s none of _your_ business, Two!"
"Yes, it _is_ his business!"
"and I’ll tell him—it was for
bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions."
"Well, of all the unjust
things—"
"Would you tell me,"
"why you are
painting those roses?"
"Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a
_red_ rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the Queen
was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know. So
you see, Miss, we’re doing our best, afore she comes, to—"
The Queen! The Queen!
"and besides, what would be the use of a
procession,"
"if people had all to lie down upon their
faces, so that they couldn’t see it?"
"What’s your name, child?"
"My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,"
"Why, they’re only a pack of cards, after
all. I needn’t be afraid of them!"
And who are _these?_
How should _I_ know?
"It’s
no business of _mine_."
Off with her head! Off—
"Consider, my
dear: she is only a child!"
You make me giddy.
"What _have_ you been doing
here?"
"May it please your Majesty,"
Off with their heads!
You shan’t be beheaded!
Are their heads off?
"Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!"
Can you play croquet?
It’s—it’s a very fine day!
"She’s under
sentence of execution."
Did you say ‘What a pity!’?
"I don’t think it’s at all a pity. I said
‘What for?’"
She boxed the Queen’s ears—
"The Queen will hear you! You see, she came rather late, and the
Queen said—"
Get to your places!
Off with his head!
Off with her head!
"what would become of me? They’re dreadfully
fond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that there’s any
one left alive!"
"It’s the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk
to."
How are you getting on?
"It’s no use
speaking to it,"
"till its ears have come, or at least one
of them."
"I don’t think they play at all fairly,"
"and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can’t hear
oneself speak—and they don’t seem to have any rules in particular; at
least, if there are, nobody attends to them—and you’ve no idea how
confusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there’s the
arch I’ve got to go through next walking about at the other end of the
ground—and I should have croqueted the Queen’s hedgehog just now, only
it ran away when it saw mine coming!"
How do you like the Queen?
"—likely to win, that it’s hardly worth while finishing the game."
Who _are_ you talking to?
"It’s a friend of mine—a Cheshire Cat,"
"allow me to
introduce it."
"I don’t like the look of it at all,"
"however, it may
kiss my hand if it likes."
"and don’t look at me like
that!"
"A cat may look at a king,"
"I’ve read that in some book,
but I don’t remember where."
"Well, it must be removed,"
"My dear! I wish you would
have this cat removed!"
Off with his head!
"I’ll fetch the executioner myself,"
"but it doesn’t
matter much,"
"as all the arches are gone from this side
of the ground."
"It belongs to the
Duchess: you’d better ask _her_ about it."
"You can’t think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old thing!"
"When _I’m_ a Duchess,"
"I won’t have any pepper in my kitchen _at all_. Soup
does very well without—Maybe it’s always pepper that makes people
hot-tempered,"
"and vinegar that makes them sour—and camomile that makes
them bitter—and—and barley-sugar and such things that make children
sweet-tempered. I only wish people knew _that_: then they wouldn’t be
so stingy about it, you know—"
"You’re thinking
about something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. I can’t
tell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in
a bit."
"Perhaps it hasn’t one,"
"Everything’s got a moral, if only
you can find it."
"The game’s going on rather better now,"
"and the moral of that is—‘Oh, ’tis love,
’tis love, that makes the world go round!’"
"that it’s done by everybody minding
their own business!"
"Ah, well! It means much the same thing,"
"and the moral of
_that_ is—‘Take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of
themselves.’"
How fond she is of finding morals in things!
"I dare say you’re wondering why I don’t put my arm round your waist,"
"the reason is, that I’m doubtful about
the temper of your flamingo. Shall I try the experiment?"
"flamingoes and mustard both bite. And
the moral of that is—‘Birds of a feather flock together.’"
"Only mustard isn’t a bird,"
"what a clear way you have of
putting things!"
"It’s a mineral, I _think_,"
"Of course it is,"
"there’s a large mustard-mine near here.
And the moral of that is—‘The more there is of mine, the less there is
of yours.’"
"it’s a vegetable. It doesn’t look like one, but it is."
"I quite agree with you,"
"and the moral of that
is—‘Be what you would seem to be’—or if you’d like it put more
simply—‘Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might
appear to others that what you were or might have been was not
otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be
otherwise.’"
"I think I should understand that better,"
if I had it written down: but I can’t quite follow it as you say it.
"That’s nothing to what I could say if I chose,"
"Pray don’t trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,"
"Oh, don’t talk about trouble!"
"I make you a present
of everything I’ve said as yet."
A cheap sort of present!
"I’m glad they don’t give
birthday presents like that!"
"I’ve a right to think,"
"Just about as much right,"
"as pigs have to fly; and
the m—"
"A fine day, your Majesty!"
"Now, I give you fair warning,"
"either you or your head must be off, and that in
about half no time! Take your choice!"
"Let’s go on with the game,"
Off with his head!
"Off with
her head!"
"Have
you seen the Mock Turtle yet?"
I don’t even know what a Mock Turtle is.
"It’s the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,"
"I never saw one, or heard of one,"
and he shall tell you his history.
You are all pardoned.
"Come, _that’s_ a
good thing!"
"and take this young lady to see the Mock
Turtle, and to hear his history. I must go back and see after some
executions I have ordered;"
What _is_ the fun?
"It’s all her fancy, that: they never
executes nobody, you know. Come on!"
"Everybody says ‘come on!’ here,"
"I never was so ordered about in all my life, never!"
What is his sorrow?
"It’s all
his fancy, that: he hasn’t got no sorrow, you know. Come on!"
"This here young lady,"
"she wants for to know your
history, she do."
"I’ll tell it her,"
"sit
down, both of you, and don’t speak a word till I’ve finished."
"I don’t see how he can _ever_ finish, if he doesn’t begin."
"I was a real
Turtle."
"Thank you, sir, for your interesting story,"
"When we were little,"
"we went to school in the
sea. The master was an old Turtle—we used to call him Tortoise—"
"Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn’t one?"
"We called him Tortoise because he taught us,"
really you are very dull!
"You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple
question,"
"Drive on, old fellow! Don’t be all
day about it!"
"Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn’t believe it—"
I never said I didn’t!
"We had the best of educations—in fact, we went to school every day—"
"_I’ve_ been to a day-school, too,"
"you needn’t be so
proud as all that."
we learned French and music.
"Ah! then yours wasn’t a really good school,"
"Now at _ours_ they had at the end of the bill,
‘French, music, _and washing_—extra.’"
"You couldn’t have wanted it much,"
"living at the bottom
of the sea."
I couldn’t afford to learn it.
"I
only took the regular course."
"Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,"
"and then the different branches of Arithmetic—Ambition,
Distraction, Uglification, and Derision."
"I never heard of ‘Uglification,’"
"What! Never heard of
uglifying!"
"You know what to beautify is, I suppose?"
it means—to—make—anything—prettier.
"if you don’t know what to uglify
is, you _are_ a simpleton."
What else had you to learn?
"Well, there was Mystery,"
"—Mystery, ancient and modern, with
Seaography: then Drawling—the Drawling-master was an old conger-eel,
that used to come once a week: _he_ taught us Drawling, Stretching, and
Fainting in Coils."
What was _that_ like?
"Well, I can’t show it you myself,"
"I’m too
stiff. And the Gryphon never learnt it."
"I went to the Classics master,
though. He was an old crab, _he_ was."
"I never went to him,"
"he taught
Laughing and Grief, they used to say."
"So he did, so he did,"
And how many hours a day did you do lessons?
"Ten hours the first day,"
"nine the next, and so
on."
What a curious plan!
"That’s the reason they’re called lessons,"
because they lessen from day to day.
"Then the eleventh day must have been
a holiday?"
"Of course it was,"
And how did you manage on the twelfth?
"That’s enough about lessons,"
tell her something about the games now.
"Same as if he had a bone in his throat,"
You may not have lived much under the sea—
and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster—
"—so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a
Lobster Quadrille is!"
What sort of a dance is it?
"you first form into a line along the
sea-shore—"
"Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on;
then, when you’ve cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way—"
"_That_ generally takes some time,"
Each with a lobster as a partner!
"advance twice, set to partners—"
"—change lobsters, and retire in same order,"
—as far out to sea as you can—
Turn a somersault in the sea!
"Back to land again, and that’s all the first figure,"
"It must be a very pretty dance,"
Would you like to see a little of it?
"Come, let’s try the first figure!"
"We can do without lobsters, you know. Which shall sing?"
I’ve forgotten the words.
Will you walk a little faster?
"There’s a porpoise close behind us, and he’s treading on my tail.
See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!
They are waiting on the shingle—will you come and join the dance?
Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, will you join the dance?
Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, won’t you join the dance?
“You can really have no notion how delightful it will be
When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!"
"Too far, too far!"
What matters it how far we go?
"There is another shore, you know, upon the other side.
The further off from England the nearer is to France—
Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.
Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, will you join the dance?
Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, won’t you join the dance?"
"Thank you, it’s a very interesting dance to watch,"
"and I do so like that
curious song about the whiting!"
"Oh, as to the whiting,"
"they—you’ve seen them,
of course?"
I’ve often seen them at dinn—
"I don’t know where Dinn may be,"
"but if you’ve
seen them so often, of course you know what they’re like."
"They have their tails in
their mouths—and they’re all over crumbs."
"You’re wrong about the crumbs,"
"crumbs would
all wash off in the sea. But they _have_ their tails in their mouths;
and the reason is—"
"Tell her about the reason and all that,"
"that they _would_ go with the
lobsters to the dance. So they got thrown out to sea. So they had to
fall a long way. So they got their tails fast in their mouths. So they
couldn’t get them out again. That’s all."
"it’s very interesting. I never knew so much
about a whiting before."
"I can tell you more than that, if you like,"
"Do you
know why it’s called a whiting?"
"I never thought about it,"
"_It does the boots and shoes_,"
Does the boots and shoes!
"Why, what are _your_ shoes done with?"
"I mean, what
makes them so shiny?"
"They’re done with blacking, I believe."
"Boots and shoes under the sea,"
are done with a whiting. Now you know.
And what are they made of?
"Soles and eels, of course,"
any shrimp could have told you that.
"If I’d been the whiting,"
"I’d have said to the porpoise, ‘Keep back,
please: we don’t want _you_ with us!’"
"They were obliged to have him with them,"
"no
wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise."
"why, if a fish came to _me_,
and told me he was going a journey, I should say ‘With what porpoise?’"
Don’t you mean ‘purpose’?
"I mean what I say,"
"Come, let’s hear some of _your_ adventures."
"I could tell you my adventures—beginning from this morning,"
"but it’s no use going back to yesterday,
because I was a different person then."
"No, no! The adventures first,"
explanations take such a dreadful time.
"_You are old, Father William_,"
"It’s all about as curious as it can be,"
It all came different!
"I
should like to hear her try and repeat something now. Tell her to
begin."
"Stand up and repeat ‘’_Tis the voice of the sluggard_,’"
"How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!"
I might as well be at school at once.
"’Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,
“You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair."
"That’s different from what _I_ used to say when I was a child,"
"Well, I never heard it before,"
"but it sounds
uncommon nonsense."
"I should like to have it explained,"
"She can’t explain it,"
"Go on with the next
verse."
But about his toes?
"How _could_ he turn
them out with his nose, you know?"
It’s the first position in dancing.
"Go on with the next verse,"
"it
begins ‘_I passed by his garden_.’"
"I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,
How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie—"
"What _is_ the use of repeating all that stuff,"
"if you don’t explain it as you go on? It’s by far the
most confusing thing _I_ ever heard!"
"Yes, I think you’d better leave off,"
Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?
Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song?
"Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,"
"Hm! No accounting for tastes! Sing her ‘_Turtle Soup_,’ will you, old
fellow?"
"Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,
Waiting in a hot tureen!
Who for such dainties would not stoop?
Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!
Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!
    Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!
    Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!
Soo—oop of the e—e—evening,
    Beautiful, beautiful Soup!
“Beautiful Soup! Who cares for fish,
Game, or any other dish?
Who would not give all else for two p
ennyworth only of beautiful Soup?
Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?
    Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!
    Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!
Soo—oop of the e—e—evening,
    Beautiful, beauti—FUL SOUP!"
What trial is it?
"Soo—oop of the e—e—evening,
    Beautiful, beautiful Soup!"
"I wish they’d
get the trial done,"
and hand round the refreshments!
because of his great wig.
"And that’s the jury-box,"
"and those twelve creatures,"
I suppose they are the jurors.
"What are
they doing?"
"They can’t have anything
to put down yet, before the trial’s begun."
"They’re putting down their names,"
for fear they should forget them before the end of the trial.
"Silence in the
court!"
"A nice
muddle their slates’ll be in before the trial’s over!"
"Herald, read the accusation!"
"The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,
    All on a summer day:
The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,
    And took them quite away!"
"Not yet, not yet!"
"There’s a great
deal to come before that!"
"Call the first witness,"
"I beg pardon, your
Majesty,"
"for bringing these in: but I hadn’t quite finished
my tea when I was sent for."
"You ought to have finished,"
When did you begin?
"Fourteenth of March, I _think_ it
was,"
"Take off your hat,"
"I keep them to sell,"
"I’ve none
of my own. I’m a hatter."
"and don’t be nervous, or I’ll
have you executed on the spot."
"I wish you wouldn’t squeeze so,"
I can hardly breathe.
"I can’t help it,"
"You’ve no right to grow _here_,"
"you know you’re growing
too."
"Yes, but _I_ grow at a reasonable pace,"
"not in
that ridiculous fashion."
Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert!
"or I’ll have you
executed, whether you’re nervous or not."
"I’m a poor man, your Majesty,"
"—and I hadn’t begun my tea—not above a week or so—and what with the
bread-and-butter getting so thin—and the twinkling of the tea—"
The twinkling of the _what?_
"It _began_ with the tea,"
Of course twinkling begins with a T!
"Do you
take me for a dunce? Go on!"
"I’m a poor man,"
"and most things twinkled after
that—only the March Hare said—"
leave out that part.
"Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said—"
I cut some more bread-and-butter—
But what did the Dormouse say?
"That I can’t remember,"
or I’ll have you executed.
"I’m a poor man, your Majesty,"
"You’re a _very_ poor _speaker_,"
"I’m glad I’ve seen that done,"
"I’ve so often read in
the newspapers, at the end of trials, “There was some attempts at
applause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the
court,"
"If that’s all you know about it, you may stand down,"
"I can’t go no lower,"
"I’m on the floor, as it is."
"Then you may _sit_ down,"
"Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!"
"Now we shall get
on better."
"I’d rather finish my tea,"
"—and just take his head off outside,"
Call the next witness!
Your Majesty must cross-examine _this_ witness.
"Well, if I must, I must,"
What are tarts made of?
"Behead that Dormouse!
Turn that Dormouse out of court! Suppress him! Pinch him! Off with his
whiskers!"
"Call the
next witness."
"Really, my
dear, _you_ must cross-examine the next witness. It quite makes my
forehead ache!"
"—for they
haven’t got much evidence _yet_,"
"Oh, I _beg_ your pardon!"
"The trial cannot proceed,"
"until
all the jurymen are back in their proper places—_all_,"
"not that it signifies much,"
"I should think it would be _quite_ as much use in the
trial one way up as the other."
What do you know about this business?
"_Un_important, your Majesty means, of course,"
"_Un_important, of course, I meant,"
important—unimportant—unimportant—important—
"but it doesn’t matter a bit,"
"Rule
Forty-two. _All persons more than a mile high to leave the court_."
"_I’m_ not a mile high,"
"Nearly two miles high,"
"Well, I shan’t go, at any rate,"
"besides, that’s not a
regular rule: you invented it just now."
"It’s the oldest rule in the book,"
"Then it ought to be Number One,"
"There’s more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,"
"this paper has just been
picked up."
"I haven’t opened it yet,"
"but it seems to be a
letter, written by the prisoner to—to somebody."
"It must have been that,"
"unless it was written to
nobody, which isn’t usual, you know."
Who is it directed to?
"It isn’t directed at all,"
"in fact, there’s
nothing written on the _outside_."
"It isn’t a letter, after all: it’s a set of verses."
Are they in the prisoner’s handwriting?
"and that’s the queerest
thing about it."
"He must have imitated somebody else’s hand,"
"I didn’t write it, and they
can’t prove I did: there’s no name signed at the end."
"If you didn’t sign it,"
"that only makes the matter
worse. You _must_ have meant some mischief, or else you’d have signed
your name like an honest man."
"That _proves_ his guilt,"
It proves nothing of the sort!
"Why, you don’t even know
what they’re about!"
"Where shall I begin, please
your Majesty?"
"Begin at the beginning,"
"and go on till you
come to the end: then stop."
"They told me you had been to her,
    And mentioned me to him:
She gave me a good character,
    But said I could not swim.
He sent them word I had not gone
    (We know it to be true):
If she should push the matter on,
    What would become of you?
I gave her one, they gave him two,
    You gave us three or more;
They all returned from him to you,
    Though they were mine before.
If I or she should chance to be
    Involved in this affair,
He trusts to you to set them free,
    Exactly as we were.
My notion was that you had been
    (Before she had this fit)
An obstacle that came between
    Him, and ourselves, and it.
Don’t let him know she liked them best,
    For this must ever be
A secret, kept from all the rest,
    Between yourself and me."
"That’s the most important piece of evidence we’ve heard yet,"
so now let the jury—
"If any one of them can explain it,"
"I’ll give him sixpence. _I_ don’t believe there’s
an atom of meaning in it."
"_She_ doesn’t believe there’s
an atom of meaning in it,"
"If there’s no meaning in it,"
"that saves a world of
trouble, you know, as we needn’t try to find any. And yet I don’t
know,"
"I seem to see some meaning in them, after all.
“—_said I could not swim_—"
Do I look like it?
"All right, so far,"
"‘_We know it to be true_—’ that’s the jury, of
course—‘_I gave her one, they gave him two_—’ why, that must be what he
did with the tarts, you know—"
"But, it goes on ‘_they all returned from him to you_,’"
"Why, there they are!"
"Nothing can be clearer than _that_. Then
again—‘_before she had this fit_—’ you never had fits, my dear, I
think?"
"Then the words don’t _fit_ you,"
"Let the jury consider their verdict,"
Sentence first—verdict afterwards.
"The idea of having the
sentence first!"
Off with her head!
Who cares for you?
You’re nothing but a pack of cards!
"Wake up, Alice dear!"
"Why, what a long sleep you’ve
had!"
"Oh, I’ve had such a curious dream!"
"It _was_ a curious
dream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it’s getting late."
